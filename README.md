# Raja Portfolio V4X

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with React and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

Ensure `npm install` is run before building so that Vite and other dependencies are available.
